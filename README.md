## Introduction
What do all great, addictive games have in common? Mind-numbing-ness. I dare you to tell a middle-aged woman to delete Candy Crush off her phone without getting jumped. If you made me delete my off-brand Scrabble (WordMaster) off my phone I would probably go catatonic. Thus, slight stupidity seems to be the way to go. Enter: off-brand Candy Crush! But the candies are teachers because Find Ricky C did really well last year and who doesn't have at least one teacher they would like to crush. 

## Value/Use
Games bring students together. On Community Council Mr. Church was harping on us about how the HW community is severely lacking in school spirit and none of us care about each other or our school (he may have a point) so this game could be a way for us to bond. In theory. 

## User Interaction and Experience

## Competitive Element
Expanding on those previous pointsâ€“ our community is also very competitive. While using money (look below) and such will get people interested, competition is what will make it fun. 

## Engagement and Addictiveness Strategies
Real monetary benefits. While we focus on growth on campus, it would be easy to provide some sort of monetary prize to the winner(s) after each month. This would get students a lot more invested in each round, without us having to predict what kind of game is actually intrinsically the most addictive.
